**Objective:**  
Design a secure **LAN/WAN topology** for HealthPlus Pharmacy Group with 8 outlets across Fiji, ensuring scalability and efficient network management.

**Requirements:**  
- Design interconnecting devices (routers, switches) and end devices (computers, printers, cameras, VoIP phones).  
- Plan network for current and future device growth.  
- Configure subnets for servers and branches with IP address management.  
- Justify design, devices, and transmission media.  
- Include screenshots of connectivity tests in Packet Tracer.  

**Tools Used:**  
- Cisco Packet Tracer (network simulation)  
- Microsoft Word / MS Visio (documentation, design diagrams)  

**Skills Demonstrated:**  
- LAN/WAN design and planning  
- IP addressing and subnetting  
- Network security and segmentation  
- Device selection and justification  
- Technical report writing

## Assignment 2 – XYZ Corporation Network Analysis and Security
**Objective:**  
Analyze and configure a **corporate network** to implement VLANs, DHCP, and ACLs, ensuring secure communication between departments.

**Requirements:**  
- Subnet the network using **VLSM** for multiple departments (Sales, HR, Finance, IT, Management, Servers, Printers).  
- Configure VLANs for each department.  
- Configure DHCP pools for dynamic IP allocation.  
- Implement **Router on a Stick** inter-VLAN routing.  
- Configure **ACLs** to enforce access restrictions between departments.  
- Test network connectivity and security rules using Packet Tracer.  

**Tools Used:**  
- Cisco Packet Tracer (network simulation)  
- Microsoft Word (report with tables and subnet calculations)  

**Skills Demonstrated:**  
- Subnetting using VLSM  
- VLAN configuration and management  
- DHCP configuration for multiple subnets  
- Inter-VLAN routing (Router on a Stick)  
- ACL configuration for network security  
- Network troubleshooting and simulation  
- Technical report writing
